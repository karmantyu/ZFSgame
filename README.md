ZFSguru (Revival Module)

ZFSguru was a specialized FreeBSD-based storage distribution designed to provide an easy-to-use web interface for managing the system and ZFS pools.

This ZFS-oriented storage distribution aimed to bridge the gap between complex command-line administration and a user-friendly GUI. The interface was written largely in PHP and ran on the lighttpd web server. The project was created by submesa and later maintained by CiPHER. For unknown reasons, it was abandoned in 2016, with the final release being 0.3.1.

To pay homage to this great project, I decided to revive it as a 10th Year Anniversary edition—implemented as a module for the Webmin interface. It was a fun project and a solid proof of concept, heavily leveraging coding AI to port the codebase from PHP to Perl.

Please try this module as-is and use it with caution. Do not test it on production systems, as it has only been lightly tested so far. Have fun with it—responsibly.

Sincerely,
